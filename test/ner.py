20 Things To Do On Long Island In The Summer
things to do on long island in the summer
From the causal seaside towns of the south shore to the elite streets of the Hamptons, the list of things to do on Long Island in the summer is vast and varied.

Here, summer means lazy beach days and sunsets on the boardwalk, waterfront dining and getting out and enjoying the beautiful gardens and parks in full bloom.

These summer staples are all about nostalgia, tradition and creating new memories.

Beach Days
When the warmer months arrive, Long Island starts to feel like one big beach town. Right after Memorial Day, flip flops and swimsuit cover-ups become almost standard attire as most people are either on their way to or from the shore on any given day. Here are ten of our favorite local beaches.

Garden Exploration
Long Island is home to a generous number of beautiful and historic former estates, many of which are now public gardens.

At the Planting Fields Arboretum State Historic Park in Oyster Bay, guests are free to wander the grounds of the Gold Coast estate and its formal gardens and greenhouses. Old Westbury Gardens is also open for tours and self-guided exploration and offers a variety of special summer events, including weekly yoga.

For a scenic walk or quiet picnic, other must-visit gardens and mansions that make for perfect Long Island day trips include Sagamore Hill, the “Summer White House” of Theodore Roosevelt, and the Bailey Arboretum, where you can stroll the estate of renowned horticulturist Frank Bailey completely free of charge.

Adventureland  
Just about everyone who has grown up on Long Island has an Adventureland memory. The Farmingdale amusement park has been entertaining locals with its range of rides, attractions and games since 1962.

Conquer “Merrick Mountain”
The next time you’re on the Meadowbrook Parkway on your way to Jones Beach, look for the windmill on the top of the hill. That’s the summit of Norman J. Levy Park and Preserve, informally known as “Merrick Mountain.” A refurbished landfill-turned plant and wildlife sanctuary, you can say it’s the best looking dump around.

Great for recreation and relaxation, the park includes three miles of hiking and jogging trails, 18 exercise stations, a 500-foot fishing pier and a kayak launch into the original Meadow Brook. At its highest point of 115 feet, there are sweeping views of the Jones Beach tower, the coastal neighborhoods below, and on a clear day, the New York City skyline. Up there you’ll also find two man-made ponds, circulated by the fully functional windmill.

Look for the park’s resident herd of Nigerian dwarf goats, which can be seen resting in their pen or wandering the trails.

Waterfront Dining and Drinks
One of the perks of being on an island is the many waterfront dining options. Here are a few popular spots in Nassau County:

Pop’s Seafood Shack & Grill, Island Park – Indoor and outdoor beach dining in a fun and relaxing setting. Fire pit, lounge and nightly entertainment.

Jordan Lobster Farms, Island Park – A Long Island classic with a backyard raw bar and seating area, indoor dining room and an attached retail store where you can buy fresh fish to take home.

Prime American Kitchen & Restaurant, Huntington – Seafood, steaks and dock views overlooking Huntington Harbor. Enjoy a meal al fresco or have a cocktail by the fire pit on a cool night.

Walls Warf, Bayville – Eat on the deck or right on the beach with views of the Long Island Sound and Connecticut in the distance.

Crescent Beach Club, Bayville – Next door to Walls Warf, the Crescent Beach Club offers the same view, but in a less casual setting.

Have an Italian Ice by the Water 
Of all the things to do on Long Island in the summer, there’s nothing more refreshing on a hot day than an Italian ice and a waterfront breeze. At Bonanza’s Italian Ices in Bayville, the Bonanza family keeps up the tradition that their great grandfather established in the early 1900’s when he started selling handmade Italian lemon ices from a pushcart in Oyster Bay. Housed in a small corner shack, Bonanza’s doesn’t look like much from the outside, but the fresh handmade ices can’t be missed. Walk to the nearby Oyster Bay Harbor and have your ice with a view.

See a Show at Jones Beach
Go to a concert at Jones Beach Theater. Click here to see when your favorite performers will be in town.

But the biggest show every year at Jones Beach happens on the beach. Every Memorial Day Weekend, the annual Bethpage Airshow draws hundreds of thousands of people eager to see a roster of fighter jets, including the U.S. Navy Blue Angels, put on a breathtaking display of tricks over the water. Admission is free (except for the standard $10 parking fee). It is suggested that visitors arrive early to dodge the inevitable traffic; however, if you want to avoid some of the crowds, you can stop by the day before to watch the planes practice.

Hit the Links  
Golf at one of Long Island’s many public golf courses, including the famed Black Course at Bethpage State Golf Course in Farmingdale. Considered one of the most difficult courses in the country, the Black Course hosted the U.S. Open in 2002 and 2009 and the PGA Championship in 2019.

Nassau County Museums
On rainy days or those hot summer days when being in the air condition beats being outside, museums make for perfect Long Island day trips. Here are a few to check out this summer:

Long Island Children’s Museum, Uniondale – A hands-on museum that encourages kids to let their imaginations run free.

The Cradle of Aviation Museum, Uniondale – Located beside the Children’s Museum in Uniondale’s Museum Row, this popular museum’s air and spacecraft displays honor Long Island’s role in aviation, and has a dome theater and planetarium. Next door, you can visit the historic Nunley’s Carousel, a treasured piece of nostalgia for anyone who grew up in the area that has been restored for future generations to enjoy.

Nassau County Museum of Art, Roslyn Harbor – On the grounds of the former Frick Estate, the mansion hosts rotating exhibitions in its gallery and has a sculpture garden with the works of renowned artists on its surrounding lawns. Walking trails lead to one discovery after another.

Old Bethpage Village Restoration
One of the most interesting places to go on Long Island, Old Bethpage Village Restoration allows visitors to step back in time. This “living history museum” consists of 36 houses, barns and buildings dating from 1765 through 1865, in which you’ll find costumed interpreters that deliver facts and stories about the people who occupied them. And on weekends in the summer, you can catch an old timey baseball game.

strawberry picking on long island
Long Island Farms and Wine Country 
Beginning in late May, Long Island’s farm country starts to come alive. Strawberry picking is one of the most popular things to do on Long Island in the summer, with farms like Lewin Farms that allow visitors out into the fields to harvest their own. Strawberry season is only a few weeks, but other fruits, veggies and berries soon follow.

Lavender by the Bay grows fields of lavender at their farms in East Marion and Calverton. There are serval bloom periods from late spring to early fall, but the French lavender peak in July is something you have to see (and smell!) to believe.

Summer is also peak season for the Long Island wine trail. There is no better staycation than sharing a bottle at one of the winery tasting rooms along the South and North Forks overlooking the vines and listening to live entertainment.

For a different way to experience Long Island wine country, bike tours such as East End Bike Tours include tastings, gourmet meals and exclusive guided stops. For an unforgettable winery experience with friends, hop aboard the North Fork Wine Wagon, a fun contraption that allows up to 14 people to pedal and sip their way through select vineyards as a professional driver steers.

The Hamptons
Spend some time like the Island’s elite, taking in some of the top beaches, food, wine and nightlife that the area has to offer. On your way, don’t forget to stop at the Big Duck.

FIND AND BOOK A HOTEL IN THE HAMPTONS

Visit a Lighthouse
Visit a lighthouse for great photo ops and beautiful outlooks. Here are a few you can’t miss:

Montauk Lighthouse, Montauk State Park – The oldest lighthouse in New York State (authorized by President George Washington in 1792) and a National Historic Landmark, it is understandably one of the most popular destinations (and picture spots) on Long Island. Paired with the expansive scenic views of the Atlantic Ocean, it’s hard to beat. While you’re there, you can climb to the top, walk the park or visit the museum, which is located in the 1860 keepers’ house.

FIND AND BOOK A HOTEL IN MONTAUK

Fire Island Lighthouse, Captree Island – Take the 182 step tour of this iconic black and white tower and enjoy the panoramic view of the ocean and surrounding region, which extends all the way to the New York City skyline on a clear day. Of course, Fire Island is a top summer destination in itself. Take the ferry over to experience the beaches, nightlife and car-free streets of this one-of-a-kind little piece of paradise.

Horton Point Lighthouse, Southold – See the lighthouse, tour the exhibits and have a picnic on the grounds. Head 120 steps down to the beach or walk the nature trail.

Splish Splash
Fun in the sun is what it’s all about at Splish Splash water park in Calverton, which has been rated as one of the top water parks in the country.

More Fun Stuff To Do With Kids 
White Post Farms, Melville –Little ones get the opportunity to hand and bottle feed goats, interact with birds in the free flight aviary and encounter more exotic animals like kangaroos and lemurs.

Long Island Game Farm, Manorville – The largest children’s zoo and wildlife park on Long Island, the Long Island Game Farm has been a part of family memories on Long island for almost 50 years. Here the kids can get up close and personal with baby animals, deer, camels and more.

Long Island Ducks Baseball, Central Islip – A fun baseball experience that comes at a much friendlier price tag than a major league game. Arrive early as Duck players sign autographs 15 minutes before starting time. Not only will the kids have a blast cheering on the Atlantic League Champions (2004, 2012 and 2013), they’ll love Quackerjack the mascot and running the bases after the game. Fireworks on select nights.

Riverhead Raceway – Built in 1949, this is one of the oldest stock car race tracks in the country and the only NASCAR stock car track in the New York metropolitan area. There are 5 to 6 racing divisions every Saturday night with an average car count of 150 cars, and special shows such as the Demolition Derby.

Fish Hatchery, Cold Spring Harbor – A former trout hatchery, this non-profit educational center teaches visitors about the freshwater ecosystems of New York. While you are here you can check out the largest living collection of fresh water reptiles, fish and amphibians in New York State, tour the two aquarium buildings and eight outdoor ponds and even feed the trout.

Outlet Shopping
Retail therapy feels even better in the pleasant outdoor setting of the Tanger Outlets in Deer Park and Riverhead. Aside from great deals on designer brands, they also have places to eat, occasional special events and both locations have a movie theater, so it’s fun for the whole family.

Go Camping
Get in touch with nature at one of Long Island’s campgrounds. Consider on one of these:

Hither Hills State Park, Montauk – A 189-site campground at Hither Hills State Park on the ocean that offers a beach as well as scenic picnic areas, fireplaces, sport fishing, bridle paths and hiking, nature and biking trails. The unique “walking dunes” of Napeague Harbor are a highlight of the park.

Wildwood State Park Campground, Wading River – 600 acres of undeveloped forest that ends on a high bluff overlooking Long Island Sound. In addition to swimming and fishing in the Sounds, visitors have access to a picnic area, playground and hiking trails.

Smith Point County Park Campground, Shirley – Suffolk County’s largest oceanfront park. A popular spot for residents and tourists alike during the summer season, the park has a beach that’s great for surfing and fishing, showers, a playground, food concessions and special events. Campsites (reservations required) and outer beach camping are available (first come, first served).

Watch Hill Marina and Campground, Fire Island – Campgrounds, including 26 sand sites are in a protected area behind the dunes just a short walk to the beach. The facilities include running water, picnic tables, grills, showers and bathrooms.

Suffolk County Museums
Vanderbilt Museum, Centerport – Tour the waterfront mansion of William K. Vanderbilt and explore the museum, which includes the thousands of marine, bird and insect specimens that he collected during his oceanic expeditions and trips around the world. Don’t miss the planetarium.

Heckscher Museum of Art, Huntington – The museum’s permanent collection includes 15-20th century American and European paintings, presented alongside limited time exhibitions and various programs, lectures and events.

Cold Spring Harbor Whaling Museum – Located in Cold Spring Harbor, which was a whaling port in the 19th Century. Highlights include a scrimshaw collection, ship models, artifacts and tools used by whalers, and New York State’s only fully-equipped 19th century whaleboat with original gear.

The Long Island Aquarium
Among numerous indoor and outdoor exhibits of marine and other wildlife, the Long Island Aquarium in Riverhead boasts a massive coral reef display, shark tank and year-round sea lion shows. The fairly small size of the Atlantis-themed aquarium allows for lots of up-close-and-personal experiences, including touch tanks and other interactive encounters such as sea lion selfies and penguin meet and greets. On a nice day, the 90 minute Atlantis Explorer Boat Tour down the Peconic River is a relaxing and educational trip.

Spend a Day in Port Jeff
And we can’t leave out a day in Port Jefferson. With a variety of restaurants (Old Fields, The Pie, The Fifth Season), fun food stops (Toast Coffee House, The Secret Garden Tea Room, Sweet n’ Savory Creperie Crepe and Rice Pudding Bar), unique shops and popular retail stores, it’s no wonder that this waterfront village is a summer hotspot. From here, you can also take the ferry to Connecticut.
